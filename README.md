**Completed First Task on Mentorness: Rollback Transaction**
I’m excited to announce that I’ve completed my first task assigned by #Mentorness, focusing on Rollback Transactions in database management!

Rollback Command Overview
The ROLLBACK statement is a crucial command in SQL used to undo and discard changes made within a transaction. This ensures that if an error occurs during a series of operations, the database can revert to its previous stable state, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

Key Benefits of the ROLLBACK Command:
Data Integrity: Ensures that partial changes do not corrupt the database.
Error Handling: Allows safe reversal of operations if an error is detected.
Consistency: Maintains the database in a consistent state by undoing incomplete transactions.

**Completed Second Task on Mentorness: COVID-19 Data Analysis Project through SQL Queries**
Introduction :
This project involves a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data to understand its spread and impact over time and across different regions. The analysis covers various aspects such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and provides insights at both monthly and country levels.

Objectives
Monthly Analysis:

Calculate the total number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases for each month.
Determine the average, variance, and standard deviation of these cases per month to understand the spread and impact of the virus over time.
Country-Level Insights:

Identify the country with the highest number of confirmed cases.
Find the country with the lowest number of death cases.
List the top 5 countries with the highest number of recovered cases.
