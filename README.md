Completed First Task on Mentorness: Rollback Transaction
I’m excited to announce that I’ve completed my first task assigned by #Mentorness, focusing on Rollback Transactions in database management!

Rollback Command Overview
The ROLLBACK statement is a crucial command in SQL used to undo and discard changes made within a transaction. This ensures that if an error occurs during a series of operations, the database can revert to its previous stable state, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

Key Benefits of the ROLLBACK Command:
Data Integrity: Ensures that partial changes do not corrupt the database.
Error Handling: Allows safe reversal of operations if an error is detected.
Consistency: Maintains the database in a consistent state by undoing incomplete transactions.
